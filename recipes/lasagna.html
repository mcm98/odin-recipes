            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>

            <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <strong>Step 1</strong>

        <p>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.
        <p>Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, 
        Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. 
        Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>

        <strong>Step 2</strong>
            
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
         Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p>
        <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
         remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>

        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        
        <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>

        <strong>Step 4</strong>

        <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
        Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
        Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices.</p>
        <p>Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and 
        sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
        Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil 
        does not touch the cheese.</p>  
        
        <strong>Step 5</strong>

        <p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. 
        Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
